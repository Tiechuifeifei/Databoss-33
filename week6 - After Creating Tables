## Development Workflow

### After Creating the Database Tables

1. **Validate table structure**  
   Confirm primary keys, foreign keys, and necessary fields for Auctions, Bids, Items, Users, and Watchlist.

2. **Check business logic compatibility**  
   Ensure the schema supports required functions such as creating auctions, placing bids, updating current price, ending auctions, and watchlist operations.

3. **Set up backend database connection**  
   Create `db.php` and implement commonly used SQL query functions.

4. **Implement auction features**  
   - browse.php (listing items and auctions)  
   - item.php (show item details and bid history)  
   - place_bid.php (processing bids)  
   - create_auction.php (seller creates auctions)

5. **Test the end-to-end flow**  
   User → Item upload → Auction creation → Bidding → Auction automatically ends.
